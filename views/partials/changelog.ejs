                <ul>
                    <li>Added skip shields! Users can now add a shield to any song in the queue or the currently playing song to prevent it from being skipped by others. One shield blocks one skip.</li>
                    <li>Improved the Now Playing section to match the same style and information display as the queue.</li>
                    <li>The Now Playing section now displays the track length and the remaining time.</li>
                    <li>Updated the payment system to reflect new pricing for skips (now 75 Digipogs, previously 125) and skip shields (25 Digipogs).</li>
