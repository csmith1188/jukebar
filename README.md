# Jukebar

Jukebar is a Node.js classroom jukebox that integrates with Spotify and Formbar. Users pay with Digipogs to queue songs, skip tracks, buy skip shields, start community ban votes, and manage custom playlists.

## Features

- **Spotify playback and queue control**
- **Formbar OAuth login** with session-based auth
- **Digipog payment flow** for songs, skips, shields, ban-vote starts, and playlist actions
- **Skip Shield system** (buy shields to protect a song; blocked skips consume one shield)
- **Anonymous mode** (queue songs without leaderboard credit)
- **Track ban system**
    - Teacher/owner direct bans with required reason
    - Community ban voting (minimum 5 users online required)
- **Teacher Playlist Allowlist** — teachers allow/disallow Spotify playlists for student queue purchases; cost is computed from playlist size
- **Custom Playlists** — students create personal Spotify playlists, add/remove songs, and pay to play them
- **User moderation** (ban/unban users, teacher transaction views)
- **Leaderboard** with automatic weekly reset
- **Real-time updates** with Socket.IO
- **Recently queued history** per user with album art
- **JukePix integration**
    - Toggle bridge on/off
    - Global/default visual settings
    - Per-artist and per-song overrides
    - Configurable skip/shield sound selection
- **Spotify diagnostics** endpoint for teachers
- **SQLite persistence** for users, queue metadata, bans, transactions, playlists, and skip activity
- **In-app changelog** loaded from `changelog.json`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Spotify Premium account and Spotify app credentials (Development Mode or Extended Quota Mode)
- Formbar instance access and API key
- Active Spotify playback device
- Optional: `omxplayer` (Raspberry Pi — plays blocked-skip SFX)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Jukebar
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file from `.env-template` and fill in all values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

4. Set up Spotify credentials — see [`spotify_developer_setup.md`](spotify_developer_setup.md) for a step-by-step guide. Use `spotify.js` to generate your refresh token:

```bash
node spotify.js
```

5. Start the app:

```bash
node app.js
```

For development with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open in browser:

`http://localhost:5000`

## Notes

- Session and token checks gate all protected routes.
- Teacher actions require permission level `>= 4` or owner status.
- Owners bypass payment checks and receive free actions.
- Queue and moderation events are synchronized in real time via Socket.IO.
- Ban votes require at least **5 users online** to start.
- Playlists and custom playlists are scoped to the current Formbar class ID.
- Spotify's Development Mode limits apps to **10 users**. Apply for Extended Quota Mode to remove this limit.
- The `spotify.js` script generates a Spotify refresh token. Credentials are loaded from `.env` — never hardcode them.
- The batch `GET /tracks` Spotify endpoint was removed for Development Mode apps in February 2026. Track lookups use individual `GET /tracks/{id}` calls.
